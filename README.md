# [Weather App - JavaScript app](https://revalew.github.io/WeatherApp/)

This is the app created using JavaScript as a part of the website developement course.

What I want to achieve:
- I want to learn how to create websites, write functional apps in JavaScript and how to use Git & GitHub,
- This repository was created to practice working in a shared environment.
